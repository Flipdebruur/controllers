# Use ADC pins (note: pins 2 and 4 are digital input only on ESP32, so use ADC-capable pins only)
# Since GPIO2 and GPIO4 are not ADC pins on ESP32, they cannot be used for analog reading.
# Instead, if you want to use 5 analog sensors, use GPIO25 and GPIO26 for example.

# So corrected pins:
sensor_pins = [34, 33, 15, 2, 4]  # Left, Left Mid, Middle, Right Mid, Right
sensors = [ADC(Pin(pin)) for pin in sensor_pins]

# Configure all for full 0–3.3V range
for sensor in sensors:
    sensor.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)

def read_sensors():
    return [s.read() for s in sensors]  # Returns list of 0–4095 values
