# === MAGGIE Full Robot Controller ===
# MAGGIE is a robot that has a stepper motor that moves a belt with a magnet on it so it can grab boxes with a magnetic strip
# This code controls MAGGIE on a predetermined grid using 3 (simulated) ground sensors, 2 proximity sensors, 2 wheels and 1 swivel wheel.
# It must go the course, pick up 4 boxes, return, and unload them at specific coordinates.
